# Econ Ipsum

A Laurem Ipsum generator that uses words from Economics journals. The only two files required to create an Econ Ipsum api are [main.py](main.py) and [dictionary.p](dictionary.p).

Most of the files that are needed to generate [dictionary.p](dictionary.p) are in the [dgen](dgen) folder. However, the folder does not contain the `all.xml` file that contains all of the abstracts. This cannot be included for copyright reasons.
